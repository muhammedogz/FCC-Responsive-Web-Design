                        <p>Mark Grayson was born the son of Nolan and Deborah Grayson.  Nolan was the beloved superhero Omni-Man an alien with fantastic abilities.  Mark learned this at seven years of age and that he was sent to Earth to protect it.  Mark was anticipating the day when he would gain his own powers and when he was a senior in high school, he finally gained them while working on his part time job.  Supportive of his son, Nolan helped Mark become a superhero, providing him with a costume and allowing him to choose his own superhero name: Invincible</p>
